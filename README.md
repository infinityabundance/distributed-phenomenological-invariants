## About

This work extends the concept of phenomenological invariants from
individual systems to collections of interacting systems. It shows how
compatible invariant structures can be distributed across interacting
systems under irreversible time, giving rise to shared constraints that
stabilize coordinated continuation without centralized control.

The paper formalizes conditions for shared invariant formation,
characterizes collective coherence requirements, and articulates how
distributed identity persistence emerges through conserved shared
commitments. It also identifies structural constraints that limit
persistent incoherent divergence in multi-system contexts.
